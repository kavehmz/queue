// Queue is a simple Queue system written in Go that will use Redis underneath.
// Focus of this design is mainly horisontal scalability via concurrency, paritioning and fault-detection
// Queues can be partitions in to more than one Redis and each redis can keep more than one queue.
//
// Number of redis paritions is set by using Partitions function and setting slice of Redis URL connections.
// To set number of queues in each redis you can use QueuesInPartition functions.
//
// Partitioning factor to identify where each event must save is the task ID which is set while using AddTask.
// RedisParition => Id % redisParitions
// Queue => (OrderID/redisParitions) % queuePartitions
//
// If more than two or more tasks are added with the same ID, this library will make sure they are all sent to the same analyzer.
// Using the same ID can help in cases that there is a relation between some tasks and they must be analyzed together.
